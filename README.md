Azure: Virtual Network Gateway Diagnostics (VPN)
================================================

            

 


This script sample demonstrates how the Azure Virtual Networks PowerShell cmdlets can be utilized to gather Azure Gateway Diagnostics data. This logging is useful for troubleshooting VPN connection issues, and includes messages such as MainMode SA (Phase
 1) and QuickMode SA (Phase 2) negotiation. Output data is saved to your Azure storage account, and then is downloaded to a local text file for viewing.


 


 

 
 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
